- **Attendance Policy:**

The attendance policy requires attendance at all Zoom class sessions.  Excessive absence may be expected to lower a grade and/or result in a failing one.  Attendance is required for class participation and activity assignments. Absences will only be excused if they are prearranged and approved by the instructor. An absence on a quiz or final exam date will result an automatic 20 point deduction.

  

**2.**  **Incompletes:** Incompletes will not be **considered** unless circumstances beyond the student’s control prevent the completion of all the course requirements. Should such a situation arise, the student is expected to establish contact with the instructor as soon as possible and state in writing how and when the incomplete is to be completed. No less than 75% of all work has to be completed and turned into the instructor before and Incomplete can be considered. 

  

**3. Withdrawal:** Withdrawal from class is the student’s responsibility and should be handled as outlined in Northern New Mexico College Student handbook. Lack of regular class attendance does not constitute an official class withdrawal and results in an “F” grade.  The instructor will not withdraw student from class.

  

- **Academic dishonesty: Plagiarism, Academic Dishonesty, and Ethics:** You are expected to cite sources, as needed, taking caution to not plagiarize. You must do your own original work -- and appropriately identify that portion of your work which is collaborative with others, or borrowed from others, or which is your own work from other contexts. Whenever you borrow graphics, quote passages, or use ideas from others, you are legally and ethically obliged to acknowledge that use, following appropriate conventions for documenting sources. If you have doubts about whether or not you are using your own or others’ writing ethically and legally, ask your instructor. Follow this primary principle: _Be up front and honest_ about what you are doing and about what you have contributed to a project. If you fail to report your use of another’s work, you will be in danger of committing plagiarism, which may result in failing the class and expulsion from school. For further clarification please refer to the current NNMC Catalogue.
- **Policy on Student Disruption:** You are expected to behave respectfully courteously, and professionally in your interactions with your peers as well as with the instructor. Posting comments that are discriminatory or which have indications of sexual harassment and will not be tolerated.

  

**Late Assignments:** You are expected complete and submit all assignments by the due date. **Late ! submissions will NOT be accepted**

The Accessibility and Resource Center (ARC) is the campus office that collaborates with students who have disabilities to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations._ In accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; if you have a documented disability, you may request accommodations to obtain equal access and to promote your learning in all classroom settings.
