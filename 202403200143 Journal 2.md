right now  I feel stressed out of my mind, I don't know why but it just feels like my mind is flooded with so much right now. I'm even getting a headache I don't know why. I'm trying to calm down and sleep but I cant its so much. what can i do? I'm trying journaling to feel better and I hope it helps but I cant think I'm trying to but I cant, I'm even trying hard not tho think about how I'm writing bc its to much. is it my anxiety, maybe, but I'm not for sure, its like my mind is running a 1000 miles right now and i cant stop it. i keep thinking about Chelsea, like that time when she told me i was standing to close, i just start overthinking weather she thinks that i like her or that I'm a creep like others that she knows, if she does. it doesn’t help that i want to talk to her but i cant. i avoided her and i feel that she was avoiding me too. i don’t like her and i want to tell her that but i start overthinking that she might like me and idk it a lot to go through all i know is i don’t want to lose her as a friend but its hard right now that we are thinking and feeling two different ways right now. what can i do? tell her that i don’t like her in that way and just really see her as a good friend. does that seem like i do tho and I'm trying to let her guard down, there I'm
going again overthinking everything. i feel bad i cant do anything about this situation. i want to try figuring this out but cant . i want to stop overthinking. i want to stop this anxiety over every little thing i do. i feel that I'm not good enough right now. i want space but the more space i have the more depressed i get. can i stop it. idk i want to try getting better but i feel that I'm trying to hard. i feel i have to do everything for others. i want to help myself. i want to feel better. i want to get better, I'm tired of the sleepless nights and the constant pain. i want to feel better about helping me. but i feel that its bad to do that.i just get more depressed thinking and i cant help it, i don’t want anyone to feel how i feel but i want someone there for me, but there isn’t at least no one that thinks about me first. i think about everyone and try to do my best to be a good friend for everyone. I'm trying my hardest to be social and make friends, but everyone has there friends without me. don’t get me wrong i do have friends and I'm their friend, but I'm not there go to friend like the one that they go to for everything or think about constantly. i barely get texts calls and when i do text i feel that I'm a burden or that I'm just bothering them. am i not good enough to be the go to friend? I'm i always going to be the friend that they go to when they have no one to go to I'm tired of it. i tired of trying and i want to stop. i feel I'm not good enough for anyone. who would want to be a friend to me. the actual me. the one that overthinks and cant get there mind straight and has to constantly be reassured that they matter. i don’t feel that i matter to anyone. i cant even tell people that i love them bc i feel that i don’t need it, that everyone already found that person and i will always be forgotten. i didn’t go to school and no one texted me, no one called, no one even tried to see if i was ok. I'm tired of me being the one to talk, to text, to cal, and not just for something important, but to talk and laugh and be able to be myself and not this husk that i show everyone. no want to see the true me, so i show them the happy mask that everyone loves. to everyone else, they see the outgoing, sometimes introverted, always happy and never fails to be funny jeremy. but inside I'm depressed and just feel that I'm not needed, not wanted, only there to be someone they want to go to when there other friends aren’t around and when i talk about me it has to be about what they are talking about bc they don’t want to hear about me. who would, they don’t care. all the intrusive thoughts just flood my mind sometimes, like no matter what i do its wrong, and I'm to blame for everything wrong in my life. no likes intrusive thoughts but they just think that they are the casual suicide thought, but to me it a lot more then what they think. its graphic and i have no control over what i think sometimes. any time that i look at anyone i have to think what they are thinking then i think of what i would say to there thought then the intrusive thoughts start come like sexualizing them or killing them. i don’t want to act on any of them bc thats to much, i don’t even want to think about it. i cant even say these thoughts bc then people will start thinking I'm a psychopath or something, but then sometime i do feel that i am. why would i think of that, idk i don’t want to but i do. maybe i do want to and I'm just telling myself that i don’t to conform to society? idk but doing this, putting all my thoughts on paper actually helped me a lot. i still have a headache but I'm feeling a lot better now. maybe journaling was a good idea. they do say that journaling is good mentally and physically. lets just hope i can keep going without making it a point in my life. this doesn’t need to be a task and i don’t want to make, i mean if i could do this when I'm feeling that i need to it would help a lot more. ill see bc i don’t feel journalling will help if you are forcing yourself to do it.
