# Creating a Good MOC
MOCs (Maps of Concepts) are a great way of taking in ideas, notes, and other useful information and linking it all with common ideas, or big ideas. MOCs may not be for everyone, but here are some ways you can set up a MOC of any kind.

MOCs is a great way to organize your notes, but also make sure you not getting stuck trying to make is pretty or aesthetically pleasing, this is yours weather its just you looking at it or others, so make it yours. Don’t build a system that you work for, build one that works for you.

## Making a good Home directory or homepage
When using notes with links and tags, its really easy for you to lose your place inside your vault or MOC, so by providing a homepage that all you MOCS can link to can make the experience much smoother.

Some things that can be one you home page:
- An index or table of contents
	A index is a list of links to all your MOCs in your vault that you can go back to when you need to. The index can also have a system to it if that helps as well (the system that i use for my index is a dewey-like decimal system).
- List of tags
	Tags a great way to link notes and other things in your vault without adding a link inside of the note. These tags can be searched later on and depending on how big your MOC is, can be very helpful in the future. Example of this is #books  which brings up a list of books and my notes on them.
- Inspiration
	Inspiration is one the biggest things that you can have in your homepage and you MOC, used to get you going and to connect you to your vault in a better way that notes can’t. Some inspiration that you can use is quotes, pictures, memes, and other things that connect to you in a strong way. Remember that you vault is not only a place for your thoughts but also to learn about everything about you.
- To-Dos
	If there is anything that need to be done in one of your MOCs, put them down as tasks, and complete them as you work through your system. These tasks can be as small as adding a new note to as big as making a new project, put them down.
- Anything else
	With all this information in your brain it is better to just let it out than letting it sit there not being used, so add in anything that seem good for you on the homepage, and if it becomes irrelevant or bigger than the homepage, make it into a smaller topic, add it into a different MOC, or make it into its own MOC. This is your vault, make it yours.
