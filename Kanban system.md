If you’re tracking multiple projects with dynamic timelines, then the Kanban system can help you see things through. It can help you visualize tasks and determine stages of work progress. 

Today the Kanban system is integral to several task management and time tracking apps like [Asana](https://www.timedoctor.com/blog/asana-time-tracking/), [Trello](https://www.timedoctor.com/blog/trello-time-tracking/), [Toggl Track](https://www.timedoctor.com/blog/toggl-versus-time-doctor/), Microsoft Project, etc. 

Here’s how you can use the Kanban system to boost employee time management: 

- **Step 1:** List your tasks in a visual format (online or on paper). Mark the ones you want to tackle first and others that you can take up later.
- **Step 2:** Figure out the time you’ll have to spend on each task, depending on the difficulty level.
- **Step 3:** Create a Kanban board with three columns: tasks to be done, tasks in progress, and tasks completed. 
- **Step 4:** Don’t have more than three tasks under the ‘tasks in progress’ column to avoid stress and tackle one task at a time.
