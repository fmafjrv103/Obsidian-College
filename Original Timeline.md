Tutorial intro story

  

In the not so distant future of 2040, earth is finally ready to send life to mars. It has taken years to develop equipment to sustain a mission, and to research the planet to ensure it is safe for exploration.

  

There are two sides to sending astronauts to Mars.

The Public (Mars Adventures and Science Administration) side and the Private(Space Zed) side. 

  

All players have been given the same starting information. Get to Mars. After that, individual goals might differ from the next person. Space Zed wishes to claim Mars to bring humanity. Tusk believes that if at least 100 people make sustainable living on the red planet, then humanity could live there forever. On the other hand, the Government just wants research. Information that could help life on earth excel more than it ever has.

  

Though this is not as easy as it seems. A few major barriers that must be revealed in time start progressing from the very beginning. How the information gets delivered, and who is on the receiving end of it. The way the players not only interact with each other, but how they interact with the tools that have been presented to them to utilize.

  

Space seems one million miles away while the astronauts prepare for departure. Little do they know getting there will most likely be the easiest part of the entire mission. 

  

The players must first prove their worth by completing training tasks that will prepare them for the flight ahead.

Act 1 - To infinity and beyond (objectives 6/7/8)

  
  

The astronauts are finally ready for takeoff. After a brief press conference, the players now find themselves inside of the spaceship to depart.

  

The astronauts must run a brief test to ensure that everything is perfect before even thinking about leaving the atmosphere.

  

Once that is done, it’s time for takeoff. The experience is intense. Pressure that is unimaginable weighing on their bodies of not only the atmosphere, but the lingering responsibility of bringing home information that could change lives forever.

  

After the crew breaches into space, they are smooth sailing for a while.

  

(Objective 6 - Loss of coms)

However when a crew member attempts to contact the ground team for information, they only receive static before SOS alarms come blaring through the ship. 

  

The crew must quickly figure out what is causing the disconnection of coms before they are stranded from any communication at all.

  

Sal will chirp in and give ship diagnostics to help their search to fix the issue. Though the fix is a bit easier than anticipated. A few antennas were moved around during the takeoff, and needed to be readjusted and recalibrated to reach the ground team properly.

  

(Objective 7- Proximity sensor)

After these events, the crew is finally approaching Mars. They must find a suitable spot from orbit to set up their base.

  

Though these astronauts have landed a ship in training numerous times, the atmosphere and change of climate pose a challenge. Using a built in Proximity Sensor on the ship,they must land safely or run the risk of damaging the ship in some type of way; effectively delaying their return before even beginning the mission.

  

While trying to land, the airlock systems begin to fail. There is an immediate sensor that tells the crew, and forces all of their helmets closed to conserve oxygen if needed.

  

The sensor will go off if they are

- Trying to land in a space that is not fit (bad alarm?)
    
- Landing in a space that is perfect (needs to make a good noise, or Sal can confirm)
    

  
  

(Objective 8 - Set up base camp)

  

The crew has now landed safely and may split up into teams to make this easier.

  

Team 1 must survey the surrounding area to ensure safety and proper cover if a wind storm were to occur.

  

Team 2 must set up the actual camp and ensure all systems are up and running.

  

While team 1 is surveying,they will notice a few anomalies but it is only material that has not yet been registered on their systems. They can go investigate and find samples of dirt or rocks that have material that could be beneficial to them.

  

Meanwhile, Team 2 is setting up the base camp. Most tasks are easy enough. Make sure the tents are sturdy and make sure the solar panels are out to charge in the correct direction to make sure they have a constant energy source. 

  

This team must ensure that the anti-contaminate chambers are working properly by putting themselves and their tools through. After a test must be done to see how effective the chamber is, and make changes accordingly.

  

Sal will help with either of these tasks if needed, but all of the information that is shared with him will be secretly shared with Space Zed. 

  

Once the teams are back together, they must work to build the food production unit. While setting up the automatic watering system, the programming will glitch out automatically at times to set back their work. What the crew does not realize is that Sal is messing with the code. 

  

At this time Sal is not out to ruin a lot, but is testing the waters to see how much he can get away with without being noticed by anyone. He will provide help to fix the codes that he was messing with to cover up his acts.
