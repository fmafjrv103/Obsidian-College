Not taking is hard, especially when you don’t know what your learning. This can demotivate you to not study enough or give up on a topic all together. But there is a way to get more information and figure it out without the intense struggle that come with learning new topics. There are two types of learning that I will talk about.
# Passive Learning
This type of learning is the process of “relearning”. Taking notes just to reread them is a type of passive learning, as well as just memorizing with flash cards. These wont make you retain any knowledge that you learned or make it stick in your brain long enough to be useful in the long run. This is where the next type of learning come in.
# Active Learning
Active learning is the type of learning that everyone want to do, but give up because its to hard for them or uncomfortable. That is unless you know how to actively learn. This process is difficult, but if you learn these ways, your brain will thank you. Active learning, just like it sounds, is the process of getting information and using it to make connections and seeing the information in your own way. One way to do this is the learning cycle.
# The Learning Cycle
- Collect
	Collecting information and putting it into note may sound simple but the reality is that most of that information may not be necessary. By figuring out how to filter the info that you’re presented, is better than writing everything down. Asking questions like, does this matter?, whats the point here?, and what’s the main idea? These will help by giving more context to what you’re putting in your notes is useful and not just things you wrote down because you didn’t know what to do with the information.
	And don’t worry about forgetting it, because this is a learning cycle and you might get it one the next cycle. Now we need to stop collecting and start
- Connect
	Memory as we know it is like a web of ideas, connected together in a complex system that we then know as memory. When we start making connections, the stronger that we will be able to recall it and know where it fits into the other connections that we have. Making connections like this is called [[Schema|schema]]. These connection make the mental model in your brain and help recall be faster and more accurate if you do this more often. But can’t improve your skill without working out that skill, and improving it.
- Challenge
	Without challenge you can’t improve your skills as a learner. When you challenge yourself, you show the weaknesses in your connection and the strengths as well. Without challenge your not going to see these weaknesses until its to late, so find them. See what’s is working and what is not and figure out how to fix those weak points. If a connection that you though was good turns out to not be, find a different way of connecting the topic to known ideas. Making these new connections will help reinforce the things that you are learning and make the recall better. Don't wait to find theses connections to test them, challenge will make the recall better if you test them. Some ways to challenge your connections is to do practice problems and teaching. Practice problems will help you with [[active recall]] and teaching will help you with knowing the whole topic that you are teaching. Great example for the teaching challenge is these notes, I write my notes as if I am teaching someone about the topic these notes are about.
When your done with the cycle, you learn new insight and reasoning that will help with the next cycle of Collect, Connect, and Challenge. With this framework and lots of practice, you will understand more and not have to use passive learning because you will understand everything that you learned with this cycle. Remember that active learning is a hard and uncomfortable process and is not easy. Use this and find your learning get better every day.
