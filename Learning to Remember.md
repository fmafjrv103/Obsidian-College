Not taking is hard, especially when you don’t know what your learning. This can demotivate you to not study enough or give up on a topic all together. But there is a way to get more information and figure it out without the intense struggle that come with learning new topics. There are two types of learning that I will talk about.
# Passive Learning
This type of learning is the process of “relearning”. Taking notes just to reread them is a type of passive learning, as well as just memorizing with flash cards. These wont make you retain any knowledge that you learned or make it stick in your brain long enough to be usefull in the long run
