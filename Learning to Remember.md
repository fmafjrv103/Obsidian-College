Not taking is hard, especially when you don’t know what your learning. This can demotivate you to not study enough or give up on a topic all together. But there is a way to get more information and figure it out without the intense struggle that come with learning new topics. There are two types of learning that I will talk about.
# Passive Learning
This type of learning is the process of “relearning”. Taking notes just to reread them is a type of passive learning, as well as just memorizing with flash cards. These wont make you retain any knowledge that you learned or make it stick in your brain long enough to be useful in the long run. This is where the next type of learning come in.
# Active Learning
Active learning is the type of learning that everyone want to do, but give up because its to hard for them or uncomfortable. That is unless you know how to actively learn. This process is difficult, but if you learn these ways, your brain will thank you. Active learning, just like it sounds, is the process of getting information and using it to make connections and seeing the information in your own way. One way to do this is the learning cycle.
# The Learning Cycle
- Collect
	Collecting information and putting it into note may sound simple but the reality is that most of that information may not be necessary. By figuring out how to filter the info that you’re presented, is better than writing everything down. Asking questions like, does this matter?, whats the point here?, and what’s the main idea? These will help by giving more context to what you’re putting in your notes is useful and not just things you wrote down because you didn’t know what to do with the information.
	And don’t worry about forgetting it, because this is a learning cycle and you might get it one the next cycle. Now we need to stop collecting and start
- Connect
	Memory as we know it is like a web of ideas, connected together in a complex system that we then know as memory. When we start making connections, the stronger that we will be able to recall it and know where it fits into the other connections that we have. Making connections like this is called [[Schema|schema]]. These connection make the mental model in your brain and help recall be faster and more accurate if you do this more often.
