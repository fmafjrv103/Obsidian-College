### Restorative Ointment

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains 1d4+1 doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh 1/2 pound.

As an action, one dose of the ointment can be swallowed or applied to the skin. The creature that receives it regains 2d8+2 hit points, ceases to be poisoned, and is cured of any disease.
