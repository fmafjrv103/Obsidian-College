The time blocking system helps you improve work focus **—** you block certain hours of your day to perform specific tasks. 

Here’s how you can implement the time blocking method for better task management:

- **Step 1:** Make a task list and highlight any repetitive tasks that you can automate. 
- **Step 2:** Estimate the time you need to dedicate to each task.
- **Step 3:** Keep some time aside for emergencies like sickness, downtime, hardware malfunctioning, etc.
- **Step 4:** If you still have any free time on your hand, use it to complete any of your pending tasks. 

You can use Google Calendar or any other calendar app to block your work time for tasks or meetings and stay in control of your work schedule. 

For effective time management, you can combine it with a time management app to track the exact time for each task and not spend more hours than you planned to.
