Bullet Journal is a daily note-taking system to organize all your task-related information. It uses various symbols for task entries so you can quickly identify whether a task is completed, postponed, or removed. 

Here’s how you can implement the Bullet Journal system:

- **Step 1:** To start with, you’ll need a journal with page numbers. Add a work-relevant title to every page. 
- **Step 2:** Under every title, you can list out specific tasks (represented by •), events (represented by ◦), and notes (represented by –). 
- **Step 3:** Depending upon the task status, mark them as completed (X), migrated (>), postponed (<), or eliminated (•). 
- **Step 4:** Add signifiers to give your bullets more context. For example, an asterisk (*) denotes a priority, while an exclamation point (!) denotes inspiration.
- **Step 5:** Create collections to organize specific types of entries.
