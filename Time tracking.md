[Time tracking](https://www.timedoctor.com/blog/benefits-of-time-tracking/) is easy to execute and can improve employee efficiency. It essentially allows you to track time spent on different tasks and projects to know where most employee time is spent. 

You can use any time tracking app for managing employee performance and identifying areas of improvement. Additionally, it can assist you in calculating [billable hours](https://www.timedoctor.com/blog/billable-hours/), [tracking attendance](https://www.timedoctor.com/blog/employee-attendance-tracker/), and processing payroll. 

Here’s how you can use the time management software for employee time tracking:

- **Step 1:** Track time for all the tasks you perform during work hours, be it as a project manager, employee, or freelancer.
- **Step 2:** Assess your timesheet on time tracking apps to identify time-consuming tasks and figure out a different approach to fastrack them. 
- **Step 3:** Implement those processes and check if the work time has come down or gone up for the same tasks on time tracking app. 

Now that we know the different types of time management systems out there, let’s understand why we need to have a time tracking system in the first place.
