**SYMPOSIUM:

We are from Espanola Valley High School and are MESA Team 1.
  

We chose these goals because our project is about flooding. It is dangerous to live on this kind of land because it causes injury and fatality. High Waters for Low Riders is also an eye-opening project for the citizens in Espanola because it allows us to come together as a community to fix and focus our attention on important issues. We hope High Waters for Low Riders will bring our community together. We can improve on low infrastructure lands to combat flooding. We want to inform our community of safe evacuation routes when it floods. Then citizens can remain safe and calm.

STAR/overview-

1. Situation - Describe the situation. “Set up the scene.” When was the problem/challenge encountered? Why was the problem/challenge significant? 

- Flooding has been an issue in Espanola for 30 years, but about 8 months ago in the Monsoon Season, the Santa Cruz Lake started to overflow. The only option seen by the city was to open the dam to let water go. This overflow of water caused flooding in some areas of Espanola, making it a hazard to live in.

  

2. Task - Explain the task. What problem/challenge did the team address? Was it a team effort? Did one or more team members take charge? Why? 

- All of our team members strived to do their best with the knowledge we had of Espanola. Unfortunately, the city hasn’t done anything about the flooding because they don’t have the proper equipment or information to fix these problems; they haven’t had a flood plains manager since 2016. Our team flew a drone at The Santa Cruz dam and a nearby Earthen dam to get a good look at them.

  

3. Action - What actions did the team or team member take to approach the problem/challenge?

- Jeremy, Angel, and our advisor Steve Cox from Northern New Mexico College flew a drone to view the landscape of The Santa Cruz dam to create a mockup of it. Jeremy then used NetLogo and QGIS to plug in Espanola’s landscapes to view where flooding would occur most so we could start looking for the safest evacuation routes. 

  

4. Result - What was the result of the actions taken? Can the team point out what features were modified? Or can the team pinpoint what was gained from taking on this problem/challenge? 

- When our team gained newer information about Espanola’s landscape, we were able to find and create escape routes that the citizens could take. Two problems with using NetLogo are that it can not locate street names or find location immediately. 

# JUDGE EXAMPLE QUESTIONS: ^b58748

b. Prompt Category #2: Design Evolution & Troubleshooting  ^3c3e8c

1. Explain a moment when a plan in designing/prototyping failed. 
- Being able to execute the NetLogo to find locations of the user quickly and to find a route. Sometimes NetLogo uses only 2 certain roads and has difficulty reading exactly where flooding is in the moment. 
  

2. Describe a time when your team went through some unexpected changes. 
- Our team had difficulty sending the STL file for our flooding to show without a code, for our 3D printed model.
  

c. Prompt Category #3: Impact & Recommendations 

1. Describe the impact this project had on your user. 
- The city planning and zoning was surprised that this was an ongoing problem, they mentioned they haven’t had a flooding plains manager since 2016 and directed us to talk to the mayor and the city manager to fix the issues with flooding that we’ve been having for the last 30 years.
  

2. Describe an important skill the team used for preparing for today.

- Design Overview: The team adequately articulates how their prototype addresses the user’s needs. An overview should also include how the prototype addresses the selected UN Sustainable Development Goal and the SDG target.

  

How does our prototype address these UN Goals? 

  

High Waters for Low Riders is to protect the citizens of Espanola (U.N Goal 15-life on land). These people are in danger every time flooding occurs because Espanola is a rural place with low infrastructure. Although we can not change the infrastructure of Espanola, we decided to take a digital and non-invasive approach. This prototype shows the safest evacuation routes they can take to ensure their safety. 

  

Our project allows us to speak on climate change to our community and come together to make more changes about such impacts. In the future, we hope to overcome the low infrastructure by communicating with our community. High Waters for Low Riders will allow us to understand what we must change so everyone can be safe.**
