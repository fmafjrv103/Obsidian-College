# Interests 
Welcome to the Interests MOC. It can be quite a sprawling content map. 
## Using the [[Dewey Decimal System]]

Note: There’s a reason this MOC is called interests and not Dewey. It isn’t about the whole decimal system; it’s about your interests. We’re just using Dewey’s basic outline as a fixed _spatial constellation_ upon which to easily add dots of new interests to it.
