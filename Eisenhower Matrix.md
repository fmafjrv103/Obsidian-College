The **Eisenhower** **Matrix** is a time management system that divides tasks based on their importance.

You divide your tasks into four quadrants for effective [[202403200202 Time Management|time management]]: 

|                   |                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|                   | **Urgent**                                                                                                               | **Not Urgent**                                                                                                            |
| **Important**     | Quadrant 1  <br>It includes tasks with approaching deadlines that you should do immediately without delay.               | Quadrant 2  <br>It includes tasks of secondary importance that you can schedule for a later date on your Google Calendar. |
| **Not Important** | Quadrant 3  <br>It includes tasks that don’t require your involvement and you can delegate them to your junior employee. | Quadrant 4  <br>It includes tasks that you should eliminate to use your work time more judiciously.                       |

Based on this template, you can decide which tasks need your immediate attention and which tasks can be postponed or delegated, or eliminated for the time being. 

This time management system is quite useful when you’re swamped with multiple project management tasks, and it’s hard to identify what’s urgent. It helps you quickly sort your action items and tackle each task in order of priority.
