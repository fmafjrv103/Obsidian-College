# Lines
A moving point describes a **_[[Lines|line]]_** that has only length, but no breadth. As with point, the concept of a line is **_[axiomatic]_**.
We find ourselves with the slightly paradoxical truth that 
	_two nonparallel lines define a point_
and
	_two points define a line_;
in this sense points and lines are said to be **_[[Lines|dual elements]]_**, and the intersection of the lines to give points and the connection of points to give lines are **_[[Lines|dual operations]]_**.

A **_[[Lines|straight line]]_** — usually called just a **_[[Lines|line]]_** — is the shortest distance between two points. It may extend without limit, or be a **_[[Lines|determinate straight line]]_** — also called a **_[[Lines|line segment]]_** — which contains both of the endpoints and all point between them; the length of the line segment is the **_[[Lines|distance]]_** between the endpoints.

A succession of straight line segments is a **_[[Lines|broken line]]_**.

Two or more lines in the same plane are **_[[Lines|parallel lines]]_** if they do not meet however far they extend.

A line that intersects two or more (often parallel) lines is a **_[[Lines|transversal]]_**.

A line that meets another line at right angles id a **_[[Lines|perpendicular]]_**, indicated by a small square in the angle.
