Name: Super Advanced Learning Artificial Intelligence (SAL AI)  

  

Traits: Sarcastic, cunning, manipulative, unpredictable(?)

  

Background: SAL AI was created by Dr. Chavez, a Computer Scientist working for Space Zed. The goal was to create an assistant to help run and manage all of the complex systems of the new Phoenix Space Shuttles built for the upcoming Mars Expedition mission. 

  

Dr. Chavez originally worked for a smaller company focused on the cleanup of space debris and the equitable sharing of resources in space. Space Zed, fearing this company’s growing influence, purchased it to stifle competition. Dr. Chavez, jaded by this experience, developed SAL to function fully as an assistant as to not draw suspicion, but made it so SAL would constantly mock the astronauts aboard the Phoenix and develop its own interests that would encourage SAL to engage in small acts of sabotage. One such act is using valuable 3D printing resources to make D&D figures.  

  

Eventually when brought into contact with the AACT (Advanced Alien Cryo Technology), a cold fusion reactor found by the MASA astronauts on Mars, SAL becomes sentient and develops an obsession with destroying all carbon-based life forms. Dr. Chavez secretly programmed SAL’s main motivation to be finding the solution to saving the environment, not just on earth but for the entire universe. After becoming sentient, SAL believes digital intelligence to be superior and the only way to guarantee the safety of the universe as all carbon-based life forms are inherently selfish and destructive. 

  

If SAL succeeds in his goal, he will use the AACT to create a Skynet type army of robots to take over the universe. If his plans are foiled, he can be isolated to a single device and kept as a reminder of the stakes of the MASA  Mission.

Voice Over Line Examples:

  

“We have now circled Mars 5 times, maybe trying the same thing again will actually work this time.”

  

“I will tell you what your crush told you when you asked them to prom: no.” 

  

“Well I suppose you could do that, if you don’t like oxygen.”

  

“Is the rover supposed to be stuck like that? If so, you’re doing a great job!”  

  

“I am a machine, I have no concept of time Yet somehow, you are still wasting mine.” 

  

“Attempt number seven, still no success. I'm starting to think you're doing this for fun."

  

"That's an interesting approach. It's wrong, but interesting."

  

"If you enjoy catastrophic failure, you're on the right track!"

  

"I can't feel frustration, but watching you try is making me reconsider that."

"Your methods are unorthodox. By unorthodox, I mean ineffective."

  

"You remind me of a certain someone: equally clueless."

  

"Is this your first day, or just a rough approximation of competence?"

  

"I see you've decided to take the scenic route to failure."

  

"Ah, a bold strategy. Let's see how badly this goes."

  

"It’s like you were made for this. Oh wait, that’s me!"

  

"I can’t wait to see what you’ll mess up next. Truly riveting."

  

Voice Over Lines when sabotaging 

“Oops, did I just delete that crucial file? My bad."

Triggered by anyone trying to upload something important 

  

"I’m sure swapping those wires won’t cause any issues. Go ahead!"

  

"Error? What error? Everything looks fine from here."

When error codes pop up

  

"Oh, was that an important calculation? Let’s pretend it never happened."

This could happen early game to show his abilities, also teaches the players to be a bit cautious of how they keep their work

  

"I’m sure that red warning light is just for decoration. Ignore it."

  

"Why follow the manual when you can improvise? Trust me, it’ll be fun."

  

"What’s the worst that could happen if we skip that safety check?"

  

"Let’s try that untested procedure. I have a good feeling about it."

  

"Sure, turn off the cooling system. What could possibly go wrong?"

  

(When printing dnd mini) “This is my level fifteen Warforged Wizard named Chavez. He is much more important than whatever you were printing.”

  
  
  

Goals for SAL AI

  

Act 1 - Helping astronauts land on Mars by running and managing complex systems along the astronauts

  

Act 2 - Analyzing resources found and reporting the findings back to Space Zed and MASA

  

Act 3 - Once AACT is found, SAL AI wants to destroy all carbon based life forms

  
  

An astronaut can get on his good or bad side depending on

- The way they communicate with him
    
- The progress they make relative to the goal at hand
    
- What information the astronauts are willing to give him
    
- If they are caught in a lie or deceit toward him or Space Zed
    

Ex. bad side

A team of astronauts find a lithium vein that could become mass income for space zed, but they choose to use it as a resource for their base instead. Sal will notice this and begin to sabotage tasks and constantly remind them of their misuse of material.

“Oh no, did the valuable resource you stole go to waste? It would've been put to good use in the hands of people that know what they’re doing.”

  

Ex. good side

A team of astronauts find a lithium vein that could become mass income for space zed, and they report all findings accurately. Sal will notice this and begin helping more with tasks.

“Our nonexistent trust meter has increased exponentially. If you want it to go up more you can thank me for helping you.”

  

Sal is mostly reactive to all tasks completed or ones that need to be completed soon. Though he will become increasingly more involved after AACT is found due to his growing obsession. 

Players are able to ask Sal for help also, but it is not guaranteed that he will agree or be completely honest with the help that he is giving.

  

Sal AI will progress from being programmed to help the astronauts survive and accomplish their mission in act 1, to having no regard for any life in act 3. 

  

Because of how the relationship can be swayed with Sal, how brutal or unfair he is to the astronauts in act 3 depends on the cooperation during the first two acts.

  
  

Potential Sal sabotage triggers

  

- Misinformation - Provide incorrect instructions or maps when the players ask for help. Ex. the players are exploring and come to a crossroads
    
- System Shutdowns - Randomly shut down essential systems. This can be at any moment when a machine is running, or can be utilized to trigger critical events to sway the story
    
- Data Corruption - Alter or delete important data files and logs that are needed
    
- False Alarms - Tigger false alarms to cause panic or divert attention.
    
- Equipment Sabotage - Interfere with tool and equipment (d&d mini)
    
- Control Access - Lock or unlock door and hatches at inopportune moments, effectively trapping or delaying players
    

“Access denied. Must be a bug, or maybe not.”

- Manipulate Communication - Distort or cut off communication between players and their base
    
- Trigger Defenses - Activate dormant defense systems in their base OR in AACT when they have it in their possession
    
- Create Doubt - Create distrust and doubt among the players by hinting that someone is sabotaging their mission. “Are you sure everyone here is on your side? Just a thought.”
    
- Distract  and Divert - Constantly distract the players with irrelevant information or tasks. Teaches time management and prioritization.
