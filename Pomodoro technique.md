Pomodoro is a popular time management technique that recommends 25 minutes of super-focused work followed by a 5 minute [break](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2019/12/27/take-a-break-its-the-most-productive-thing-you-can-do/?sh=517514823ec0). It minimizes the chances of [burnout](https://www.timedoctor.com/blog/employee-burnout/) by allowing **intermittent breaks** throughout the workday. 

Here’s how you can deploy the Pomodoro technique for efficient use of your work time:

- **Step 1:** Choose a task and work on it uninterruptedly for 25 minutes. 
- **Step 2:** When the time management software indicates the end of 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break to stretch and unwind. 
- **Step 3:** Continue working with absolute focus again for another 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. You can reward yourself by extending the break time of every fourth break by 15-30 minutes. 

You can integrate your project management software with simple [time tracking tools](https://www.timedoctor.com/blog/best-time-tracking-apps/) to follow the Pomodoro technique rigorously.
