- Roommate Selection Process
	- UNM
		- You can request a roommate preference on our housing contract. RLSH will only honor mutual roommate requests. You will need to follow these guidelines so that we may pair you with the roommate requested. You will receive an email for RLSH with the specific dates and instructions of how to request and accept your intended roommate(s).
		- Also, please note if you do not have a particular person in mind to be your roommate(s) you are able to look at students’ profiles during the roommate matching timeline. During this time you can view and message anyone on your matching profile.
	- Salem State University
		- You can learn more about roommates and the room selection process on the New Student Housing Information page. During the summer leading into your first year, you'll complete a roommate-matching questionnaire, so residence life can assign you a roommate who best matches your responses.
