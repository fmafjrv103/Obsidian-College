Today is going to be a great day. This day I believe that we will win this competition. For context, today is the day before the big competition, MESA USA, me and my teammates have been getting ready for this for weeks now, and I know that if we are going to win this, it has to be perfect. We won our last competition and have been getting second place in the rest, now if that didn’t show dedication, I don’t know what will. All I do know is that we will win this. Chealsee has been working hard on all of the slides and presentation stuff for our project while I have been working on getting the project ready for “show time”. We need this to work, Iv’e been wanting to go to nationals for a long ever since i almost got the chance to go back in middle school. If I could go it will show that Iv’e worked on something great. Ms. Patal-E believes in me to get this done and I won’t let her and my team down. Other than the competition tomorrow, I want to have a good time with my friends the whole time. This new computer shows so much potential to me that i never had. I never had a good working computer before, so it’s great that I get to spend it making this great second mind, keeps mine from overflowing with information that seems, at the time irrelevant, it’s great to see this get bigger after every note that i put in. This will hopefully also help with my writing, I always have to much in my head and if I could put it all down somewhere, I won’t feel overwhelmed when trying to do actual work. I didn’t even know i could just write that fast and long until now, like I said this is great to have. Maybe it will help after all. I need to get to bed, but thanks for hearing me out on this, it’s a great opportunity to write what I want and not something on an assignment. This may seem bad now but I hope with time this will all make sense. That’s it for today. Bye
