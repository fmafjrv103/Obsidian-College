# Notes in College Algebra

## [[Lines|Parallel Lines]]
---
- Lines that don't intersect
- Have the same slope
- Different y-intercepts

## Ex:

## [[Lines|Perpendicular Lines]]
---
- Intercept at right angles
- Negative reciprocals of each other
- Intersect at on point

## Ex:
![[Pasted image 20240315171057.png|560]]

|     m$^1$     |     m$^2$      |
| :-----------: | :------------: |
| $\frac{2}{3}$ | $-\frac{3}{2}$ |
Negative Reciprocals - $m_1=\frac{-1}{m_2}$

## Example
---
Given the equation of line one: $y=\frac{3}{5}x-2$
Find the equation of a line parallel to line 1 passing through (-1,-2)

$f(x)=\frac{3}{5}x-\frac{7}{5}$

$y-(-2)=\frac{3}{5}(x-(-1))$
$y+2=\frac{3}{5}x+\frac{3}{5}$

$\frac{3}{5}-\frac{2}{1}=\frac{3}{5}-\frac{10}{5}\\&=-\frac{7}{5} \\ y&=\frac{3}{5}x-\frac{7}{5}\end{align}$
