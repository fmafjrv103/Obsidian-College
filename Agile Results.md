With Agile Results, you can identify any three tasks that you hope to achieve by the end of the day, week, month, and year. It allows you to manage work in small chunks, which isn’t too overwhelming.  

Here are the four key features of Agile Results that can help you get better control of your life and time:

- **Monday vision:** Each Monday, note down three results you’d like to accomplish before the weekend and start working on that goal. 
- **Daily wins:** Every day, identify three important tasks you’d like to complete before the day ends. 
- **Friday reflection**: Review your work timesheet on the time tracker app on Friday. Analyze existing work processes to note three things going well and three things that require improvement. 
- **Hot spots:** Apart from figuring out the three daily and weekly tasks, you should invest your time in identifying pain points (low revenue, client dissatisfaction, etc.) and other big picture tasks related to your business.
