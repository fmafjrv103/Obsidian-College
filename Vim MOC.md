# Vim
Vim is a great tool for text editing and make everything faster by keeping all the things that you can do in it as keybindings. The keybinding are what I will be talking about in here. Obsidian doesn’t have these keybindings at first, but it does support them natively by enabling them in the settings. To enable Vim keybindings, go to ⚙ Settings>General>Vim Keybindings.
