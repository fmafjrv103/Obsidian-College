# The Bible
- This is a bible that is a compilation of two different versions of the bible. The first is the New World Translation of the bible, made by and for the Jahovah Witnesses. The second is the King James Version of the bible, the bible most christians use. This will be a bible that works as a ways to structure my thoughts and how the bible can be contradicted not only in the real world but also in the bible.
