Autofocus is a technique to help you make **faster work** [**decisions**](https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2018/mar/19/how-to-make-better-decisions) and execute tasks based on your motivation. It allows you to perform tasks that you’re more inclined to do than others. This way, it keeps you engaged in finishing your task list with the least amount of struggle. 

Here’s how you can use the Autofocus technique for successful project management:

- **Step 1:** Note down all the big or small tasks you have.
- **Step 2:** Carefully go through the tasks and choose the one that comes across as exciting or enjoyable. 
- **Step 3:** Keep working on the task for an hour or more and check it off the list on completion. 
- **Step 4:** Each time you finish a task, repeat the process from Step 2. 
- **Step 5:** Highlight the remaining tasks at the end of the workday and re-start the next day.
