Hi again, I'm right now in UB typing this out, I want to try to keep this up and I hope it works. I'm feeling anxious right now and I don’t know why but I feel like I'm overthinking the meeting with Anjelica. I want to do the things that we talked about but for some reason I feel lost, like I'm trying to do something that is out of my reach. I'm doing this to help my mental heath but how will this help my writing? I don't know, its weird. I love hanging out with friends, its feel nice to know that I do have friends. This does help somewhat, I don't know I'm just trying my best to get better, this does help but I want to try more, I want to be better with my mental health. Seeing my grades really showed me that I need to improve my writing and try to get things in on time and be better with my attendance. I want to get as much done but I feel that I'm doing to much with my time. Maybe when I get to UNM, I will be better with my time because I wont have so much to do and I will have more time to get things done. I don’t want to use this to get rid of my problems though, I want to use this to help. My problems wont go away with avoidance, thats just waiting for failure, but I want to try to get better at managing my problem, not only with this journal but also with other resources I want to get better. I don’t want to overthink it or try become perfect because nothing will be perfect. This journal has been helping because I can put my thoughts down, but will it help in the long run? Hanging with Jaiden and Liam help somewhat, like I love hanging out with them but I don’t know how to talk sometimes. My life has always been like this though.
