# Learn Like A Painter
What does that mean? It means to give things time to settle, you’re not going to learn everything right away. This is where your notes come in, by adding onto notes that you took your first time learning your problem, you can see how the knowledge grew about the topic. Like a painter, you’re not painting the full picture right away, you’re adding strokes of paint to bring in the whole picture. Treat your notes as a painting, by not getting everything right away, add as you learn, then you get the full picture, and then you finally learn. You are learning in layers. Learning the easier concepts first will more than likely 
- Go to easier concepts
	- Once you figure out those it is easier to learn the harder parts
	- If it seems too hard move on and once you gather more information, go back to it and more than likely will be easier.

# Learn Like a Hunter
Become curious about the topic, make yourself fascinated with the working of the topics, and get interested in learning them. By getting interested, you’re using the best thing about humans to help you, curiosity. When you’re curious about a topic of interest, you will naturally want to learn more. So, by using curiosity, you will be the “hunter” of knowledge about the topic, learning almost everything there is about that particular topic or idea. But the main question is, how do I become more interested in a topic that doesn’t interest me? Some ways are:
- Relating it to something interesting to us
- Relating it to the real world and the “bigger picture”
- Treat finding the answers to this topic like a game, or something fun

# Learn Like an Athlete
By persevering through learning and doing so even if it seems boring, that is learning like an athlete. Things get boring but if you show determination to get through that boredom, you can learn. Self-reflect and get the self-discipline to get through the difficult tasks in the topics no matter how boring or hard it can be. But, how do you gain the motivation to learn like an athlete? By:
- Just Do It
	Getting the motivation to do something takes action, so just doing, it will give you the motivation you need to get things done. You don’t get that motivation by sitting and waiting.
- Persevere
	Once you get the initial motivation, keep going, because progress makes us want to do more.
- Do it even if you don’t want to
	By giving ourselves no way out of the task, we will do more than when we do. Don’t give yourself the choice of doing it later, get it done, the sooner it's done the sooner you will not have to do it anymore.
- Self-reflect and analyze your weakness
	Look into yourself and see what is and isn’t working and see how you can improve those weaknesses. You’re not going to get better if you keep doing the same things that are failing you, so by looking at those flaws, you can find ways to improve those areas. If you get distracted easily, get  ANC headphones and put on music to focus on the task. Bad at time management, make a system that works(Pomodoro).
	- What is the reality of the situation?
