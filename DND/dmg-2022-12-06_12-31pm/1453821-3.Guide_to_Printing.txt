PRINTING THIS BOOK
_____________________________________________________________________________________


If you wish to print this book, I recommend using the quality print version.

The only difference between that and the original pdf is a few extra blank pages for the book to look good printed.

The size of both PDFs is Letter-size.

(you can print either document on Letter-size or A4-size. I recommend using the fit-to-page printer setting)
