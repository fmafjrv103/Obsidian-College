# Session 0: Checklist
This is a list of topics that you, the Dungeon Master, could discuss with your players during the "session zero" of a new campaign. You can also print this sheet (letter size) and have it with you during the session.
>So what's a Session Zero? 
>Session zero is a planning session that is run at the beginning of a new campaign. This session usually includes a lot of discussion between the dungeon master and the players, and sets some expectations and rules. The character creation usually also happens during this session.

### Essentials To Be Discussed
- How often you're gonna play 
	- Pick among yourselves and the schedule of others.
- Where you're gonna play 
	- Pick before each game session ends to curb any confusion.
- How much time will each session last on average 
	- Depends

- Which books from the system are allowed 
- Genre & tone of the campaign

- Level of campaign difficulty
### The DM Style
- Improvisation or preparation 
	- When improvising, give the DM time to think as they are not good at it for now and thinking on the fly will fail to give the players enough information on the topic being improvised.
- Rules flexibility 
	- Depending on the rule and the context that the rule will be applied to, the rule can stand or be taking out when needed(AKA no rule-lawyering).
- Roam flexibility 
	- You are able to roam as much as you want as long as the quest of the game session is complete or as much of it that was set for that game session.
- Experience/reward distribution 
	- Standard/ Depends
- Expectation of consequences 
	- Everyone (including the DM) will be held to the consequences provided in Session 0.
- Balance changes 
	- If the balance of the campaign starts changing, there will be changes to help keep it moving in a fun and interesting way.
- Homebrew material 
	- Homebrew material will be accepted if it doesn’t break or overpower the game.

- Required session equipment 
	- Dice
