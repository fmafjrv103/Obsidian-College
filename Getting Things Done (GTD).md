**Getting Things Done** is a time management system that emerged from the book by David Allen, Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity. 

Using this time management tool can help you get the essential tasks out of your head onto a notepad to understand better what needs to be done and when. 

The five essential steps to Getting Things Done are:

- **Capture:** List all your crucial to-dos and project management tasks for easy tracking. 
- **Clarify:** Go over your to-do list and identify any task you should remove or postpone.
- **Organize:** Categorize your tasks into different lists of work priority. Add due dates, so you never skip the deadlines. 

- **Reflect:** Keep revisiting your task list and figure out the upcoming steps and subtasks for each task. 
- **Engage:** Refer to this to-do list every day for tracking your work progress and getting more things done during your work hours.
