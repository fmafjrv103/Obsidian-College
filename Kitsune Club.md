# Critical Thinking
Kitsune are dynamic thinkers, who want to take in as much information in the shortest amount of time. This helps with learning technical skills fast, this will also leave them forgetting what they learned just as quickly. so how do you stop this from happening? By:
- Spacing out reviews of your progress
- Identify weaknesses in your knowledge
- Quiz yourself on things that you need to work on
# Motivation
Kitsune’s motivation is their biggest attribute, finding interest in even the most boring of topics. This comes with one of their biggest weaknesses as well, being too impulsive, going from interest to interest sometimes not spending enough time on a topic to learn anything. To stop this:
- don't try to multi-task on things that need more attention
- Be aware if you are moving too quickly to a different topic
- Bring yourself in if you see yourself start to do anything that is in the first two
# Time Management
Kitsune’s are very spontaneous with their time, and their schedule shows this. Their motivation changes throughout the day, so not having a set schedule works in their favor. Using this motivation on one thing will help me better when doing anything. So:
- Pick a subject to study for
- Pick a habit to build
- Pick a hobby to learn
Keep these projects on rotation, and when you get bored of one, move to another. By keeping these as the project of the day, week, or year, you will regain motivation for one, so do it, then the other, until all of them are done.
# Stress Management
Kitsune’s being a wind type shows how they get and manage stress. When are allowed to overthink, they will, making them stressed all day. This stress is more apparent when they are criticized, overthinking the little things and wondering what they can or can't do. Overthinking will then bring anxiety, and exaggerating consequences. Anxiety will follow the same patterns as your motivation, coming and going throughout the day. So by:
- Acknowledge that your anxiety comes and goes
- Remember that this doesn’t determine your actions
- Pay attention to how you react to stressors by:
	- Being mindful of your actions
	- Live in the present and not let things stay in your mind
	- Practice focus and staying on track not letting stressors derail you
Don’t let this tell you that you're only Kitsune, let your Tora and Kuma energy shine as well. Let this help you reflect on yourself and become a better you.
