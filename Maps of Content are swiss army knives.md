# Maps of Content are swiss army knives
Maps of Content (MOCs) are inherently flexible. Check out (4) different MOCs I created using the exact same 19 concepts for different purposes.

This type of awesome relational/positional thinking doesn't happen with a rigid table of contents. 

1. Mapped for daily reminders
2. Mapped by category
3. Mapped by a different personalized category
4. Mapped A-Z
