The D.U.M.B Coalition is a multinational governmental agency composed of Japan, South Korea, and many NATO members such as the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Canada, and Italy. Their goal is to create a long-term, self-sustaining base on Mars that can be used to conduct research about the Martian atmosphere and geology and to look for any signs of life. 

  

The I.D.I.O.T.S (International Domination of Intergalactic Outer-space Trade Society) composed of Russia, China, India, Iran, and North Korea, were formed in retaliation to the D.U.M.B Coalition. They have not made significant progress on a manned mission to Mars, but have successfully sent many rovers equipped with advanced lasers used to cut through sediment. They could also theoretically be used as weapons in combat. North Korea claims to be working on a spacecraft capable of reaching Jupiter, but even the fellow I.D.I.O.T.S are skeptical.

  

By pulling their resources, the D.U.M.B Coalition was able to raise a tremendous amount of money for the Mars Odyssey, but due to bureaucracy and political bickering they were unable to agree on a plan to design and build spacecraft capable of reaching Mars. They decided to make an open call for D.U.M.B bids to anyone that could make such a spacecraft. After a lengthy consideration process, they decided to award the D.U.M.B contract to Space Zed and their Phoenix Space Shuttle. Not only was the Phoenix Space Shuttle by far the most advanced spacecraft ever created, but it only had serious malfunctions that injured or killed the entire crew 20% of the time, a significant upgrade compared to its competitors. 

  

As part of the contract, the D.U.M.B Coalition agreed to allow astronauts working for Space Zed to embark on the Mars Odyssey alongside the D.U.M.B astronauts. Dr. Alan Tusk, the founder of Space Zed, also founded an electric vehicle company called Edison. Dr.Tusk is in desperate need of Lithium for Edison’s electric vehicle batteries. He hopes that by having his own workers aboard the Phoenix he can make the gathering of Lithium and other resources important for his many companies a top priority. Very similar technology is used by the D.U.M.B rovers and equipment, and the Phoenix Space Shuttle will require more fuel to be made on Mars in order to return to Earth. It will be important for the D.U.M.B astronauts to collect these resources to ensure their return home and the proper function of their D.U.M.B rovers and equipment.  

  

How is D.U.M.B. different from Space Zed?

- Since it is a governmental entity, things take a lot of time and have oversight and ethics hurdles
    
- Well intentioned for the most part, but every member country looks out for themselves first and foremost
    
- There is a president of the company, but they are mostly used for media appearances instead of decision making (Sen. Tom Carper)
