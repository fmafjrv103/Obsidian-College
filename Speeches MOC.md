# Speeches
If you give speeches in any capacity, compile them here. 

**Best Practices**
Use #speech to see all speeches. Use #speech80 as a way sort by speeches that are over 80% done. This means, they are basically finished, in theory. Use. #speechNotes to compliment a speech as a place to dump scratch notes and piles of possibly useful info.
